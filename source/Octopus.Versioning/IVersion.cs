    /// Some modelling classes need to reference the SemanticVersionConverter
    /// to ensure that constructor paramaters and properties of the type
    /// IVersion are converted to and from a SemanticVersion object.

    /// JSON converters like SemanticVersionConverter assume that
    /// any version object being stored in the database is a SemanticVersion
    /// object. This is because Octopus assumes the use of SemanticVersion
    /// in all processes other than external feeds, which do not have
    /// version information directly saved in the database.
    ///
    /// The version factory classes also need to know about the conrete
    /// classes.
    ///
    /// Outside of those two use cases, all other references to a version
    /// should be through this interface.
