## Build
The build for this repository has been converted to GitHub Actions. If a recent build hasn't been run in the last 60 days you will need to manually kick off a build [here](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Versioning/actions/workflows/main.yml). New builds will only be created once the workflow becomes active again, so if you have an open PR you will need to re-trigger the build via a new commit..
